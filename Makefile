### generic Makefile. Look at BINDIR for the prefix (/usr/bin instead of /usr/local/bin)
### Generally, but not always, /usr/local/bin is for "BSD-style" systems, while /usr/bin is for older Linux systems
### In reality, each platform has its own custom:cannot know "a priori"

### Usually a straight
### make install clean
### is good enough
