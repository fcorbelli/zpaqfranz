/*
This is zpaqfranz, a patched  but (maybe :) compatible fork of ZPAQ version 7.15
(http://mattmahoney.net/dc/zpaq.html)

Old version in FreeBSD ports archivers/paq (v 6.57 of 2014),
Debian (7.15 of 2016) et al.

From branch 51 all source code merged into one .cpp,
aiming to make it as easy as possible to compile on "strange" systems
(NAS, vSphere etc), because no make needed anymore.

So be patient if the source is not linear, updating and compilation are now trivial.

The source is composed of the fusion of different software
from different authors, therefore there is no uniform style of programming.

I have made a number of efforts to maintain compatibility with unmodified version (7.15)
and compatibility with older versions of C++, even at the cost of slow or inelegant workarounds
and as few as possible warnings.

So don't be surprised if it looks like what in Italy
we call "zibaldone" or in Emilia-Romagna "mappazzone".
As Kirk McKusick once said: "nobody has offered to pay me the $25K to have me do it"
:)

 	Hello, I am the developer of a little zpaq's fork (zpaqfranz)	(...)
	I integrated two of yours source code into mine	(...)
	Even if the performance increases very little (maybe 10%), can I use it?
	I think it is right to ask this explicitly before releasing the new version or zpaqfranz
	Thank you

		Yes, you can use any public domain code from 7-zip in any project.

	Statement of Purpose
	The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
	exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
	and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
	authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
	Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
	the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
	scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
	of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
	works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
	and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
	These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
	culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
	works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
	part through the use and efforts of others.
	For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
	expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
	associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
	is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
	elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
	terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
	Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
	1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
	protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
	Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
	limited to, the following:
	  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
		 communicate, and translate a Work;
	 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
	iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
		 likeness depicted in a Work;
	 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
		 subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
	  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
		 in a Work;
	 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
		 European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
		 protection of databases, and under any national implementation
		 thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
		 directive); and
	vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
		 world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
		 implementations thereof.
	2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
	of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
	irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
	Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
	of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
	future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
	worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
	treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
	medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
	including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
	purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
	member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
	successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
	revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
	equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
	as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
	3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
	be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
	Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
	account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
	extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
	person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
	irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
	Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
	maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
	time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
	of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
	limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
	"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
	applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
	reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
	partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
	of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
	will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
	Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
	action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
	express Statement of Purpose.
	4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
	 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
		surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
	 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
		warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
		statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
		title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
		infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
		the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
		the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
	 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
		that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
		limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
		Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
		consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
		Work.
	 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
		party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
		this CC0 or use of the Work.

		  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

My main development platforms are AMD Windows
(non-Intel Windows (arm) currently unsupported) 
and Intel FreeBSD.

I rarely use Linux or MacOS or whatever (for compiling),
so fixing may be needed.

As explained the program is single file, be careful to link the pthread library.
You need it for ESXi too, even if it doesn't work. Don't be afraid, zpaqfranz knows!

Library dependencies are minimal:   libc,libc++,libcxxrt,libm,libgcc_s,libthr

DEFINEs at compile-time: IT IS UP TO YOU NOT TO MIX LOGICAL INCOMPATIBLE DEFINITIONS!

(nothing)							// Compile for INTEL Windows
-DHWBLAKE3 blake3_windows_gnu.S		// On Win64 enable HW accelerated BLAKE3 (with assembly)
-DHWSHA1							// On Win64 enable HW SHA1 (-flaghw)
-DHWSHA2							// Enable HW SHA2 (without assembly code to be linked)
-Dunix 								// Compile on "something different from Windows"
-DSOLARIS        					// Solaris is similar, but not equal, to BSD Unix

-DNOJIT								// By default zpaqfranz works on Intel CPUs
									// (for simplicity I'll call them Intel, meaning x86-SSE2 and amd64)
									// On non-Intel a -NOJIT should runs fine on LITTLE ENDIANs
									// like Linux aarch64, Android aarch64 etc
									// On BIG ENDIAN or "strange things" like middle endian
									// (Honeywell 316) or little word (PDP-11)
									// the autotest command is for you :)
									// https://gcc.gnu.org/legacy-ml/gcc-help/2007-07/msg00343.html

-DANCIENT							// Turn off some functions for compiling in very old systems
									// consuming less RAM (ex. PowerPC Mac), no auto C++

-DBIG								// Turn on BIG ENDIAN at compile time

-DDEBUG								// Old 7.15, almost useless. Use -debug switch instead

-DESX								// Yes, zpaqfranz run (kind of) on ESXi too :-)

-DALIGNMALLOC 						// Force malloc to be aligned at something (sparc64)

-DSERVER							// Enable the cloudpaq client (for Windows)

-DGUI								// Enable the gui (ncurses on Windows)

HIDDEN GEMS
If the (non Windows) executable is named "dir" act (just about)... like Windows' dir
Beware of collisions with other software "dir"

If the (non Windows) executable is named "robocopy" runs... some kind of robocopy-like.
ex robocopy /tmp/zp /tmp/backup1 /tmp/backup2
BEWARE: those are WET RUNS (-kill automagically enabled), with -space enabled!


WARNINGS
Some strange warnings with some compilers (too old, or too new), not MY fault

My very own reporting
https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=101558

Original bug
https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=96963


STRANGE THINGS (FAQ)

NOTE1: -, not -- (into switch)

NOTE2: switches ARE case sensitive.   -maxsize <> -MAXSIZE

THE JIT (just-in-time)
zpaqfranz translate (by default) PAQL opcodes into "real" Intel (amd64 or x86+SSE2) machine code.
On other systems a -DNOJIT (ARM/Apple CPUs for example) will enforce software interpretation.
I write it BIG, #1 FAQ with newer Macintosh (M1/M2) is forgetting -DNOJIT

SHA-1 HARDWARE ACCELERATION
Some CPUs does have SHA instructions (typically AMD, not very widespread on Intel).
So you can use a piece of 7-zip by Igor Pavlov (I am sure you know 7z) that is
not really useful, but just for fun (faster BUT with higher latency).
For performances reason, no run-time CPU compatibility checks, must be turn on
via optional -hw switch
On AMD 5950X runs ~1.86 GB/s vs ~951 MB/s
The obj can be assembled from the fixed source code with asmc64
https://github.com/nidud/asmc
asmc64.exe sha1ugo.asm
Then link the .obj and compile with -DHWSHA1
Short version:  not worth the effort for the GA release
From build 58+ there is a new -DHWSHA2, without linking of asm, that accelerate SHA256 too.

STATIC LINKING
I like -static very much, there are a thousand arguments as to whether it is good or not.
There are strengths and weaknesses.
Normally I prefer it, you do as you prefer.

TO BE NATIVE OR NOT TO BE?
The -march=native  is a switch that asks the compiler to activate all possible
optimizations for the CPU on which zpaqfranz is being compiled.
This is to obtain the maximum possible performance,
while binding the executable to the processor.
It should not be used if you intend, for some reason,
to transfer the object program to a different system.
If you are compiling from source you can safely use it.

DEBIAN (and derivates)
Debian does not "like" anything embedded https://wiki.debian.org/EmbeddedCopies
zpaqfranz (on Windows) have two different SFX modules (32 and 64).
It is possible to make a Debian-package-compliant source code
with some sed (or a single sed -e) (of course remove the |)
sed -i "/DEBIAN|START/,/\/\/\/DEBIA|NEND/d"  zpaqfranz.cpp
sed -i "s/\/\/\/char ext|ract_test1/char ext|ract_test1/g" zpaqfranz.cpp
Actually, the code is inside #ifdef _WIN32, so it will be skipped on Debian 
and in general every non-Windows.

*NIX AND DOUBLE QUOTES
Please, on non-Windows systems, DO NOT FORGET THE DOUBLE QUOTES, 
especially with multipart files.
"test_????.zpaq" is good
test_????.zpaq   is BAD

TARGET EXAMPLES
```
Windows 64 (g++ 7.3.0)
g++ -O3  zpaqfranz.cpp -o zpaqfranz

Windows 64 (g++ 10.3.0) MSYS2
g++ -O3  zpaqfranz.cpp -o zpaqfranz -pthread -static

Windows 64 (g++, Hardware Blake3 implementation)
In this case, of course, linking the .S file is mandatory
g++ -O3 -DHWBLAKE3 blake3_windows_gnu.S zpaqfranz.cpp -o zpaqfranz -pthread -static

Windows 64 (g++, Hardware Blake3 implementation PLUS HW SHA1)
g++ -O3 -DHWBLAKE3 -DHWSHA1 blake3_windows_gnu.s zpaqfranz.cpp sha1ugo.obj -o zpaqfranzhw -pthread -static

Windows 64 (g++, Hardware Blake3 implementation PLUS HW SHA1/2)
g++ -O3 -DHWBLAKE3 -DHWSHA2 blake3_windows_gnu.s zpaqfranz.cpp -o zpaqfranzhw -pthread -static

Windows 64 (g++, Hardware Blake3 implementation PLUS HW SHA1/2 with GUI)
g++ -O3 -DGUI -DHWBLAKE3 -DHWSHA2 blake3_windows_gnu.s zpaqfranz.cpp -o zpaqfranzhw -pthread -static -s

Windows 32 (g++ 7.3.0 64 bit)
c:\mingw32\bin\g++ -m32 -O3 zpaqfranz.cpp -o zpaqfranz32 -pthread -static

Windows 64 (g++ 7.3.0), WITH cloud paq
g++ -O3 -DSERVER zpaqfranz.cpp -o zpaqfranz -lwsock32 -lws2_32

FreeBSD (11.x) gcc 7
gcc7 -O3 -Dunix zpaqfranz.cpp -lstdc++ -pthread -o zpaqfranz -static -lm

FreeBSD (12.1) gcc 9.3.0
g++ -O3 -Dunix zpaqfranz.cpp  -pthread -o zpaqfranz -static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc

FreeBSD (11.4) gcc 10.2.0
g++ -O3 -Dunix zpaqfranz.cpp  -pthread -o zpaqfranz -static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc -Wno-stringop-overflow

FreeBSD (11.3) clang 6.0.0
clang++ -Dunix zpaqfranz.cpp  -pthread -o zpaqfranz -static

OpenBSD 6.6 clang++ 8.0.1
OpenBSD 7.1 clang++ 13.0.0
clang++ -Dunix -O3 zpaqfranz.cpp -o zpaqfranz -pthread -static

Arch Linux
I strongly advise against using zpaqfranz on this Linux distro(s).
There is a bizarre policy on compiling executables.
Obviously no one forbids it (runs fine), but just don't ask for help.

Debian Linux (10/11) gcc 8.3.0
ubuntu 21.04 desktop-amd64 gcc  10.3.0
manjaro 21.07 gcc 11.1.0
g++ -O3 -Dunix zpaqfranz.cpp  -pthread -o zpaqfranz -static

QNAP NAS TS-431P3 (Annapurna AL314) gcc 7.4.0
g++ -Dunix zpaqfranz.cpp  -pthread -o zpaqfranz -Wno-psabi

Fedora 34 gcc 11.2.1
Typically you will need some library (out of a fresh Fedora box)
sudo dnf install glibc-static libstdc++-static -y;
Then you can compile, via Makefile or "by hand"
(do not forget... sudo!)

CentoOS
Please note:
"Red Hat discourages the use of static linking for security reasons.
Use static linking only when necessary, especially against libraries provided by Red Hat. "
Therefore a -static linking is often a nightmare on CentOS => change the Makefile
g++ -O3 -Dunix zpaqfranz.cpp  -pthread -o zpaqfranz

Solaris 11.4 gcc 7.3.0
OmniOS r151042 gcc 7.5.0
Beware: -DSOLARIS and some different linking options
g++ -O3 -DSOLARIS zpaqfranz.cpp -o zpaqfranz  -pthread -static-libgcc -lkstat

MacOS 11.0 gcc (clang) 12.0.5, INTEL
MacOS 12.6 gcc (clang) 13.1.6, INTEL
Please note:
No -static here
"Apple does not support statically linked binaries on Mac OS X.
(...) Rather, we strive to ensure binary
compatibility in each dynamically linked system library and framework
(AHAHAHAHAHAH, note by me)
Warning: Shipping a statically linked binary entails a significant compatibility risk.
We strongly recommend that you not do this..."
Short version: Apple does not like -static
g++ -Dunix -O3 zpaqfranz.cpp -o zpaqfranz -pthread
If you want to enable all kind of warnings, turn on c++11.
Apple, by default, does NOT like "long long", at all.
As I have explained several times, I had to make compromises, such as the C++17 warnings.
g++ -Dunix -O3 zpaqfranz.cpp -o zpaqfranz -pthread -std=c++11 -Wall -Wpedantic

Mac PowerPC with gcc4.x
Look at -DBIG (for BIG ENDIAN) and -DANCIENT (old-compiler)
g++ -O3 -DBIG -DANCIENT -Dunix -DNOJIT zpaqfranz.cpp -o zpaqfranz -pthread

Apple Macintosh (M1/M2)
DO NOT FORGET THE -DNOJIT!!!!!
g++ -Dunix  -O3 -DNOJIT zpaqfranz.cpp -o zpaqfranz -pthread

ESXi (gcc 3.4.6)
Note: not fully developed ( extract() with minimum RAM need to be implemented )
g++ -O3 -DESX zpaqfranz.cpp -o zpaqfranz6  -pthread -static -s

sparc64 (not tested)
try
-DALIGNMALLOC (+ other switches)

Haiku R1/beta4, 64 bit (gcc 11.2.0), hrev56721
Not very tested
g++ -O3 -Dunix zpaqfranz.cpp -o zpaqfranz  -pthread -static


Beware of #definitions
g++ -dM -E - < /dev/null
sometimes __sun, sometimes not

zpaqfranz has an internal self-testing mechanism, aimed at 'strange' systems, 
i.e. with CPUs operating differently from Intel, such as Apple M1, M2, 
PowerPC, sparc, ARM, BIG endians and so on.

The command autotest -to extracts a binary file, 
contained within the source, a (Windows-created) .zpaq archive 
for check whether the PAQL code (during extraction) is well processed.

It is essentially an interoperability test between Windows 
(taken as a known good-working model) and the "weird" host system.

It is packed with 256 "shuffled" pieces of the Iliade
https://www.rodoni.ch/busoni/bibliotechina/nuovifiles/iliade_h/testo.htm

Cantami, o Diva, del Pelìde Achille
l'ira funesta che infiniti addusse
lutti agli Achei, molte anzi tempo all'Orco
generose travolse alme d'eroi...

From version 55.16, instead of using deduplicated pseudorandom files, 
I preferred plaintext, in order to dispel any doubts about the contents of 
the binary archive: the theoretical coverage is minor, but it does not matter.

The resulting archive (sha256.zpaq), compressed by -m5 on Windows,
with every filenames == SHA-256(content),
is mime64-encoded and "splitted" into 4 strings,
becoming (inside the source code)

char extract_test1[]={"N2tT...
char extract_test2[]={"W1hY...
char extract_test3[]={"+Au5...
char extract_test4[]={"sFPj...

It is quickly possible to double-check this way (just in case...)

zpaqfranz autotest -to somewhere
zpaqfranz x somewhere/sha256.zpaq -to extracted

The sha256.zpaq should be this one
SHA-256: D90223FAEE2878D7854B9438864B4856A3C1F920C34EFB8C136A8949B54E5400 [            158.239]     sha256.zpaq

	Here start the program.
	
	zpaqfranz can use a backwards compatible archive format, using various "packages"
	Each FRANZOFFSET occupies, for each archived file, a certain space,
	upto ~500 bytes, but they are still compressed, so there is less waste

	V1 (little overhead) is the default
	V2 (up to zpaqfranz 56) is for extended hashes, like sha-3
	V3 (from zpaqfranz 57+) is variable-sized in two
	"flavours": 190 bytes and 550.
	The shorter allows very long hashes (e.g. whirlpool),
	the bigger also contains a TAR-like format for storing
	symlinks (and other information)

#ifndef NOJIT
/*
assemble();
Assembles the ZPAQL code in hcomp[0..hlen-1] and stores x86-32 or x86-64
code in rcode[0..rcode_size-1]. Execution begins at rcode[0]. It will not
write beyond the end of rcode, but in any case it returns the number of
bytes that would have been written. It returns 0 in case of error.
The assembled code implements int run() and returns 0 if successful,
1 if the ZPAQL code executes an invalid instruction or jumps out of
bounds, or 2 if OUT throws bad_alloc, or 3 for other OUT exceptions.
A ZPAQL virtual machine has the following state. All values are
unsigned and initially 0:
  a, b, c, d: 32 bit registers (pointed to by their respective parameters)
  f: 1 bit flag register (pointed to)
  r[0..255]: 32 bit registers
  m[0..msize-1]: 8 bit registers, where msize is a power of 2
  h[0..hsize-1]: 32 bit registers, where hsize is a power of 2
  out: pointer to a Writer
  sha1: pointer to a SHA1
Generally a ZPAQL machine is used to compute contexts which are
placed in h. A second machine might post-process, and write its
output to out and sha1. In either case, a machine is called with
its input in a, representing a single byte (0..255) or
(for a postprocessor) EOF (0xffffffff). Execution returs after a
ZPAQL halt instruction.
ZPAQL instructions are 1 byte unless the last 3 bits are 1.
In this case, a second operand byte follows. Opcode 255 is
the only 3 byte instruction. They are organized:
  00dddxxx = unary opcode xxx on destination ddd (ddd < 111)
  00111xxx = special instruction xxx
  01dddsss = assignment: ddd = sss (ddd < 111)
  1xxxxsss = operation xxxx from sss to a
The meaning of sss and ddd are as follows:
  000 = a   (accumulator)
  001 = b
  010 = c
  011 = d
  100 = *b  (means m[b mod msize])
  101 = *c  (means m[c mod msize])
  110 = *d  (means h[d mod hsize])
  111 = n   (constant 0..255 in second byte of instruction)
For example, 01001110 assigns *d to b. The other instructions xxx
are as follows:
Group 00dddxxx where ddd < 111 and xxx is:
  000 = ddd<>a, swap with a (except 00000000 is an error, and swap
        with *b or *c leaves the high bits of a unchanged)
  001 = ddd++, increment
  010 = ddd--, decrement
  011 = ddd!, not (invert all bits)
  100 = ddd=0, clear (set all bits of ddd to 0)
  101 = not used (error)
  110 = not used
  111 = ddd=r n, assign from r[n] to ddd, n=0..255 in next opcode byte
Except:
  00100111 = jt n, jump if f is true (n = -128..127, relative to next opcode)
  00101111 = jf n, jump if f is false (n = -128..127)
  00110111 = r=a n, assign r[n] = a (n = 0..255)
Group 00111xxx where xxx is:
  000 = halt (return)
  001 = output a
  010 = not used
  011 = hash: a = (a + *b + 512) * 773
  100 = hashd: *d = (*d + a + 512) * 773
  101 = not used
  110 = not used
  111 = unconditional jump (n = -128 to 127, relative to next opcode)
Group 1xxxxsss where xxxx is:
  0000 = a += sss (add, subtract, multiply, divide sss to a)
  0001 = a -= sss
  0010 = a *= sss
  0011 = a /= sss (unsigned, except set a = 0 if sss is 0)
  0100 = a %= sss (remainder, except set a = 0 if sss is 0)
  0101 = a &= sss (bitwise AND)
  0110 = a &= ~sss (bitwise AND with complement of sss)
  0111 = a |= sss (bitwise OR)
  1000 = a ^= sss (bitwise XOR)
  1001 = a <<= (sss % 32) (left shift by low 5 bits of sss)
  1010 = a >>= (sss % 32) (unsigned, zero bits shifted in)
  1011 = a == sss (compare, set f = true if equal or false otherwise)
  1100 = a < sss (unsigned compare, result in f)
  1101 = a > sss (unsigned compare)
  1110 = not used
  1111 = not used except 11111111 is a 3 byte jump to the absolute address
         in the next 2 bytes in little-endian (LSB first) order.
assemble() translates ZPAQL to 32 bit x86 code to be executed by run().
Registers are mapped as follows:
  eax = source sss from *b, *c, *d or sometimes n
  ecx = pointer to destination *b, *c, *d, or spare
  edx = a
  ebx = f (1 for true, 0 for false)
  esp = stack pointer
  ebp = d
  esi = b
  edi = c
run() saves non-volatile registers (ebp, esi, edi, ebx) on the stack,
loads a, b, c, d, f, and executes the translated instructions.
A halt instruction saves a, b, c, d, f, pops the saved registers
and returns. Invalid instructions or jumps outside of the range
of the ZPAQL code call libzpaq::error().
In 64 bit mode, the following additional registers are used:
  r12 = h
  r14 = r
  r15 = m

ZPAQ does not store blocks of zeros at all.
This means that they are not, materially, in the file,
and therefore cannot be used to calculate the CRC-32.
This is a function capable of doing it,
even for large sizes (hundreds of gigabytes or more in the case of thick virtual machine disks),
up to ~9.000TB
The function I wrote split a number into
its powers of 2, takes the CRC-32 code from a precomputed table,
and finally combines them.
It's not the most efficient method (some 10-20 iterations are typically needed),
but it's still decent
